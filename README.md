# Known Issues
Emojis will not show if you look them up. I cannot for the life of me figure out why this happens. They appear normally but if you enter something like ðŸ˜† into the search query then it the emoji will not show. However I have seen cases of emojis showing up normally. If you know a fix for this please add a pull request.
