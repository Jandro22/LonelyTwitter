# LonelyTwitter
A very simple twitter web scraper. For when you want simplicity.

# Known Issues
Emojis will not show. I cannot for the life of me figure out why this happens. You can search via unicode emojis, but they will NOT show up in the actual tweet. If someone finds out a solution for this I will implement it in.
